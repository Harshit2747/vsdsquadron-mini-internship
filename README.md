# Creating a virtual machine in VirtualBox for RISC-V involves downloading a compatible RISC-V disk image and configuring the virtual machine settings to match the architecture requirements. This setup allows users to emulate and run RISC-V-based software on their existing hardware for development and testing purposes.

```$gcc sum1ton.c```
```$ ./a.out```
* Running the command "gcc sum1ton.c"in a terminal would compile  the c source file "sum1ton.c"using gnu compiler collection.if succesful,it would generate an executable file named"a.out"bydefault.
